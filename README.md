# Portfolio Project

This README provides an overview of the structure and features of a Django project that showcases Python code and information in a responsive web layout.



## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Django-based web application that allows users to browse and interact with Python code files. The application features a responsive design, making it suitable for viewing on various device sizes, and dynamic content management for easy updates. Additionally, the project includes authentication features for secure access.
## Pages

- **Home Page:** Serves as the main landing page, displaying a selection of Python code files with associated images.
- **Info Page:** Provides detailed information about the project, including descriptions and explanations of the code.

## Features
- **Python File Upload:** Allows users to upload Python files and associate them with descriptions and titles.
- **Dynamic Content Management:** Easily manage and update the content of the website, including adding or editing Python code files.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website is accessible and visually appealing on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Authentication:** Implements user authentication features, including login, logout, and registration, for secure access and content management.

## Files
- `project/`: Main Django project directory containing the application and settings.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for rendering pages.
- `static/`: Contains CSS and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity.
- `media/`: Holds uploaded Python files and images.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the Python packages required for the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Create Virtual Environment:** Set up a virtual environment for the project using `python -m venv venv`.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Database Setup:** Configure the database settings in `settings.py` and run migrations using `python manage.py migrate`.
5. **Create Superuser:** Use `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create a superuser for admin access.
6. **Run the Development Server:** Start the Django development server using `python manage.py runserver`.
7. **Access the Website:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the website.

## How to Use

- **Upload Python Files:** Use the admin interface or a dedicated upload page to add new Python files and associated images.
- **Edit Page Content:** Modify the text and images on each page through the admin interface or dedicated forms.
- **View the Code:** Users can click on images or links to view the associated Python code and description.
- **Authenticate:** Log in or register to gain access to certain pages and features. Use the provided forms to manage authentication.

## Future Enhancements

- **Code Editing:** Enable users to edit code directly on the page.
- **Additional Features:** Add functionality such as code execution or collaboration tools for a more interactive experience.
