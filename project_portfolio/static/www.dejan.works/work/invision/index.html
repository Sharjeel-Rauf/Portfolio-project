		<h1>InVision</h1>
		<h3>
			Established in 2011, InVision has become the leading digital product design platform, driving exceptional user experiences globally. With comprehensive tools spanning ideation, design, prototyping, and management, InVision empowered over 5 million individuals to create and collaborate efficiently.
		</h3>
		<p>
			InVision's user base included 100% of the Fortune 100 companies and renowned brands like Airbnb, Amazon, HBO, and Uber. Operating as a fully distributed company across 25 countries, InVision has secured over $350 million in funding from investors such as Accel and Tiger Global.

		<h2>My Role</h2>
		<p>
			As part of the team at InVision, I witnessed and contributed to several pivotal moments in the company's history, including the introduction of Craft, the acquisition of Brand.ai leading to the launch of InVision DSM, and the development of Inspect.
		</p>
		<p>
			I joined InVision in January 2016, a time when Photoshop dominated the design industry. InVision distinguished itself by enabling designers to convert static designs into rapid prototypes without coding—a groundbreaking innovation.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the emergence of Sketch, InVision maintained its prototyping leadership by enhancing features and supporting Sketch files. The introduction of Craft, a suite of plugins for Sketch and Photoshop, empowered users with advanced functionalities, including live data and direct prototyping within Sketch.
		</p>
		<p>
			InVision further advanced its capabilities with the acquisition of Brand.ai, leading to the launch of InVision Design System Manager (DSM). Combining strengths from both teams, DSM allows product teams to create design systems and drive innovation at scale, akin to top design-forward companies.
		</p>
		<p>
			These initiatives, including Craft, InVision DSM, and Inspect, have not only transformed the way digital products are designed and developed but have also contributed to InVision's growth and success in the digital product design industry.

		<h2>InVision DSM (Design System Manager)</h2>
		<p>
			To meet and exceed customer expectations, we conducted a thorough redesign of InVision's Design System Manager (DSM). This involved extensive market analysis, deeper understanding of customer needs, and gathering feedback to refine our product goals for alignment with user expectations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The revamped DSM introduces several enhancements, including improved compatibility with Sketch libraries, offering users greater flexibility and richer customization options for documentation. Additionally, the redesign prioritizes improved performance and long-term stability, ensuring a seamless and reliable experience for our users.
		</p>
		<p>
			My involvement with DSM began prior to its public announcement in October 2017. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I played a pivotal role in defining features, crafting prototypes, and securing buy-in from stakeholders. I led initiatives to streamline collaboration between designers and developers, ensuring accurate implementation of design features.
		</p>
		<p>
			My responsibilities included unearthing customer insights, aligning them with business objectives, crafting frameworks and prototypes to drive decision-making processes, presenting work to secure buy-in from stakeholders and internal teams, leading cross-team initiatives to foster innovation, and spearheading the development of core web experiences for user customization and content management.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through my contributions, DSM has evolved into an invaluable tool for product teams, aligning with the practices of leading design-forward companies worldwide.

		<h2>Craft</h2>
		<p>
			In 2016, InVision LABS launched Craft, a suite of groundbreaking plugins for Sketch and Photoshop aimed at enhancing user experience. Craft offered unprecedented capabilities, including native prototyping directly within Sketch, revolutionizing the design workflow.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a member of the Craft team, I contributed to shaping user experiences for Craft Sync, Craft Prototyping, and Craft Manager. Collaborating closely with product teams, I led design sprints and conducted research to drive innovation.

		<h2>Inspect</h2>
		<p>
			Inspect simplified the design-to-development process by providing teams with easy access to measurements, colors, and assets for both desktop and mobile prototypes. Users can obtain pixel-perfect comps, export assets, and perform various tasks to facilitate the transition from design to development.
		</p>
		<p>
			By integrating Inspect into their workflow, designers experience seamless asset updating across all platforms, eliminating the need for manual exports. Engineers can effortlessly extract properties and assets from design source files within the prototype, ensuring consistency throughout the product design lifecycle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Collaboration between designers and developers often presents challenges in maintaining sync. Inspect addresses this by providing a shared platform, streamlining communication and facilitating a common goal. With engineers empowered to create prototypes or implement pixel-perfect designs swiftly, the collaboration process becomes more seamless.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the first designer on the Inspect team, I played a pivotal role in its public release. Our collaborative effort involved extensive research, customer interviews, and fine-tuning features based on feedback. I collaborated closely with the project manager to define objectives, prioritize features, and align stakeholders.
		</p>
		<p>
			The launch of Inspect has driven business growth, particularly within the enterprise market, and received enthusiastic reception from customers, demonstrating impressive user retention rates.
